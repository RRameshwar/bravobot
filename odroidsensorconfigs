IMU:
rosrun phidgets_imu phidgets_imu_node

To check if it's working:
rostopic list
rostopic echo /imu/data_raw


GPS:
rosrun nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver _port:=/dev/ttyACM2 _baud:=115200 #Default baud rate is 115200

To check if it's running:
File is gps_print.py located in documents folder
Run: python gps_print.py 
%% Note: Will stop rosrun nmea... command if it is currently running


Camera:
export ROS_NAMESPACE=my_camera
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://10.42.0.77:1311/
export ROS IP=10.42.0.77
rosrun uvc_camera uvc_camera_node _device:="/dev/video0" _width:=640 _height:=480 _camera_info_url:="file:///opt/ros/indigo/share/uvc_camera/camera_calibration.yaml"

LIDAR:
Run ls /dev/ttyACM* to find serial port
rosrun urg_node urg_node _serial_port:=/dev/ttyACM* (Replace * with port number found from command above)

To check if it's running:
File is lidar.rviz located in documents folder
Run: rviz -d lidar.rviz

OLDER LIDAR:
Run ls /dev/ttyACM* to find serial port
rosrun hokuyo_node hokuyo_node /dev/ttyACM* (Replace * with port number found from command above)

If port is locked:
Run sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM* (Replace * with port number found from command above) this unlocks that port

To check if it's running:
rostopic echo /scan
